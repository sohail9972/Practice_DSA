//    scenario is : i am given to use abstract and interfaces to implement the IsSortOperation irrespectiveog the user data
//        userr data is follows : there are constraints that have "Buses , Cars , Students , Companies, trains"
//        these all have list of elements within themseleves i have to implement a generic bounded type whioch sort therse list
//        i have to implement only one
